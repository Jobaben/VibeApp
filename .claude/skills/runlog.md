# Runlog Skill

Create session logs for all BMAD role sessions.

## When to Log

Create a runlog entry at the END of every role session.

## Log Location

`bmad/05-runlogs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<role>-<summary>.md`

Example: `2025-01-15-14-30-analyst-initial-brief.md`

## Log Contents

Use the template at `bmad/templates/runlog.template.md`:

1. **Session Info**: Date, role, approximate duration
2. **Input Artifacts**: What was read
3. **Output Artifacts**: What was created/modified
4. **Work Performed**: Summary of accomplishments
5. **Key Decisions**: Important choices made
6. **Issues Encountered**: Problems or blockers
7. **Open Questions**: Unresolved items
8. **Next Steps**: Recommended follow-up

## Best Practices

- Be concise but complete
- Document decisions and their rationale
- Note anything unusual or blocked
- Always include next step recommendation
