## How the Scoring System Works

### Data Sources
- Stock fundamental data is sourced from public APIs and may be delayed
- Data accuracy depends on third-party providers
- Not all metrics are available for all stocks
- Missing data is handled with conservative neutral defaults

### Scoring Methodology
The Service uses a **quantitative scoring system** based on:

1. **Value** (0-25 points): Valuation metrics (P/E, EV/EBITDA, PEG, P/B)
2. **Quality** (0-25 points): Profitability metrics (ROIC, ROE, margins, FCF)
3. **Momentum** (0-25 points): Price trends *(currently defaults to neutral pending Phase 4)*
4. **Financial Health** (0-25 points): Balance sheet strength (debt, liquidity, coverage)

**Total Score:** 0-100 points

### Signal Classification
| Score | Signal | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 90-100 | STRONG BUY | Exceptional opportunity (rare) |
| 75-89 | BUY | Attractive candidate |
| 50-74 | HOLD | Mixed signals |
| 25-49 | SELL | Warning signs |
| 0-24 | STRONG SELL | Major problems |

**Important:** These signals are algorithmic outputs, not human expert recommendations.

## Known Limitations

### 1. Backward-Looking Data
- Scores are based on **historical financial metrics**
- Financial statements are 3-6 months old when published
- Does not account for recent news, events, or management changes
- Cannot predict future performance

### 2. Missing Qualitative Factors
The scoring system does **NOT** consider:

- Management quality and track record
- Competitive moats and barriers to entry
- Industry trends and disruption risk
- Regulatory risks
- Geopolitical factors
- Macroeconomic conditions
- Customer loyalty and brand value
- Patent portfolios and R&D pipeline

These factors are **critical** to investment analysis and must be evaluated separately.

### 3. Sector Bias
- Some sectors naturally score higher (e.g., tech companies with high ROIC)
- Others score lower by nature (e.g., utilities with high leverage)
- Always compare stocks **within** their sector
- Sector averages may be skewed with limited data

### 4. Limited Data
- Based on publicly available fundamental data only
- No insider information or private research
- No access to management guidance or calls
- Limited to stocks with complete fundamental data

### 5. Momentum Scoring Unavailable (Phase 4)
- Currently defaults to neutral (12.5/25 points)
- No price trend analysis yet
- No technical indicators (RSI, moving averages)
- All stocks have the same momentum score until Phase 4

### 6. No Portfolio Context
- Scores individual stocks in isolation
- Does not consider:
  - Your existing portfolio holdings
  - Your risk tolerance
  - Your investment time horizon
  - Your financial situation
  - Tax implications
  - Diversification needs
