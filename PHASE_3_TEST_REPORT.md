# Phase 3 Test Report: Scoring Engine + Clear Signals

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Phase:** 3 - Scoring Engine Implementation
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - All Tests Passed**

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 implementation successfully delivers a robust, financially sound scoring system that evaluates stocks across four key factors: **Value**, **Quality**, **Momentum**, and **Financial Health**. The system has been rigorously tested and validated to ensure scores accurately reflect real-world financial fundamentals.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Implemented 4-factor scoring algorithm (0-100 points)
- ✅ Created sector benchmark calculation system
- ✅ Built detailed explanation system (strengths, weaknesses, reasoning)
- ✅ Developed API endpoints for scores and leaderboards
- ✅ Validated scoring accuracy against known stocks
- ✅ All edge cases handled properly (missing data, negative values, outliers)

---

## Scoring Methodology

### Framework
Total Score: **0-100 points** (4 factors × 25 points each)

1. **Value Score (0-25 pts):** Valuation metrics relative to sector
   - P/E ratio vs sector (8 pts)
   - EV/EBITDA vs sector (6 pts)
   - PEG ratio (6 pts)
   - P/B ratio (5 pts)

2. **Quality Score (0-25 pts):** Profitability and capital efficiency
   - ROIC percentile (10 pts) - Buffett's favorite metric
   - ROE vs sector (7 pts)
   - Net margin quality (5 pts)
   - FCF consistency (3 pts)

3. **Momentum Score (0-25 pts):** *Deferred to Phase 4*
   - Currently defaults to neutral (12.5 pts)
   - Will include: RSI, 50-day MA, 200-day MA, volume trends

4. **Financial Health Score (0-25 pts):** Balance sheet strength
   - Debt/Equity ratio (10 pts)
   - Current ratio (6 pts)
   - Interest coverage (5 pts)
   - FCF yield (4 pts)

### Signal Classification
| Score Range | Signal | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 90-100 | 🟢 STRONG BUY | Exceptional opportunity (rare) |
| 75-89 | 🟢 BUY | Attractive investment candidate |
| 50-74 | 🟡 HOLD | Mixed signals - wait for better entry |
| 25-49 | 🔴 SELL | Warning signs - avoid or exit |
| 0-24 | 🔴 STRONG SELL | Major problems - stay away |

## Known Limitations

### 1. Momentum Score Placeholder
- **Status:** Defaults to neutral (12.5/25) for all stocks
- **Reason:** No historical price data available yet
- **Timeline:** Will be implemented in Phase 4 with price history

### 2. No Historical Score Tracking
- **Status:** Can't calculate "Rising Stars" or "Falling Angels" yet
- **Reason:** Need score history table
- **Timeline:** Phase 5 (Watchlists + Engagement)

### 3. Small Dataset
- **Status:** Only 15 stocks for testing
- **Impact:** Percentile calculations less precise
- **Mitigation:** Works fine for MVP, will improve with more data

### 4. No Real-Time Updates
- **Status:** Scores calculated on-demand only
- **Timeline:** Phase 6 (Background jobs with Celery)
