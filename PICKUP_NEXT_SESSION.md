## 🎯 Next Phase: Phase 5 - Watchlists + Engagement

### Overview
Phase 5 focuses on user engagement features to drive return visits and provide personalized tracking.

### Planned Features

#### 1. Watchlist Management (localStorage-based)
**Priority: HIGH**

- **Watchlist CRUD Operations:**
  - Create multiple watchlists (e.g., "Growth Stocks", "Dividend Portfolio")
  - Add/remove stocks from watchlists
  - Rename/delete watchlists
  - View all watchlists in a sidebar or dedicated page

- **Watchlist Display:**
  - Show current scores for all watched stocks
  - Highlight score changes since last visit
  - Display signal changes (e.g., moved from HOLD to BUY)
  - Quick links to stock detail pages

- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Use React Context for watchlist state management
  - Store in `localStorage` (no auth required for MVP)
  - Create `WatchlistContext.tsx` provider
  - Add "Add to Watchlist" buttons throughout the app
  - Watchlist selector dropdown in navigation

**Files to Create:**
- `/frontend/src/contexts/WatchlistContext.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/pages/Watchlists.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/WatchlistManager.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/AddToWatchlistButton.tsx`

#### 2. Score Change Tracking
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- **Track Historical Scores:**
  - Store score snapshots over time
  - Calculate daily/weekly score changes
  - Track which component scores changed (Value, Quality, Momentum, Health)

- **Change Notifications:**
  - "New to Top 20" badge
  - "Score increased by 10+ points" alerts
  - "Signal changed" notifications
  - Highlight score trends (↑ ↓ →)

- **Backend Requirements:**
  - Create `stock_score_history` table
  - Background job to snapshot scores daily
  - API endpoint: `GET /api/stocks/score-changes?period=7d`

**Files to Create:**
- `/backend/app/features/stocks/models/stock_score_history.py`
- `/backend/app/features/stocks/services/score_tracking_service.py`
- `/frontend/src/components/ScoreChangeIndicator.tsx`

#### 3. "What Changed This Week" Dashboard
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- **Weekly Summary Page:**
  - Biggest score gainers (top 10)
  - Biggest score losers (top 10)
  - New entries to top 20
  - Signal changes across all stocks
  - Sector rotation analysis

- **Visual Components:**
  - Change percentage badges
  - Before/after score comparison
  - Mini sparkline charts showing trend
  - Filters for time period (1 week, 1 month, 3 months)

**Files to Create:**
- `/frontend/src/pages/WeeklyChanges.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/ScoreMoverCard.tsx`
- `/backend/app/features/stocks/router.py` (add `/api/stocks/weekly-changes` endpoint)

#### 4. Biggest Score Movers
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- Already covered by "What Changed This Week" dashboard
- Add dedicated section on homepage showing top 5 gainers/losers
- Add "🔥 Hot" badge to stocks with significant momentum

#### 5. Portfolio Tracker (Optional)
**Priority: LOW**

- **Manual Portfolio Entry:**
  - Add stocks with purchase price and quantity
  - Calculate unrealized gains/losses
  - Show portfolio total score (weighted average)
  - Diversification analysis (by sector)
  - Rebalancing suggestions based on scores

- **Portfolio Analytics:**
  - Risk exposure by sector
  - Average portfolio score vs market benchmark
  - Suggest sells (stocks with declining scores)
  - Suggest buys (high-scoring stocks you don't own)

**Files to Create:**
- `/frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/contexts/PortfolioContext.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/PortfolioSummary.tsx`

#### 6. AI Insights Section (Deferred from Phase 4)
**Priority: LOW (Future Enhancement)**

- Add AI-generated insights to stock detail pages
- Use OpenAI API to analyze score trends and fundamentals
- Generate natural language explanations
- Suggest catalysts and risk factors

#### 7. Peer Comparison Visualizations (Deferred from Phase 4)
**Priority: LOW (Future Enhancement)**

- Side-by-side comparison of 2-5 stocks
- Radar charts comparing score components
- Table showing key metrics
- Highlight winners in each category

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Start Phase 5 (Watchlists)
**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours

1. Create `WatchlistContext.tsx` with localStorage persistence
2. Build `Watchlists.tsx` page with watchlist management UI
3. Add "Add to Watchlist" buttons to StockCard and StockDetail
4. Update navigation with Watchlists link
5. Test watchlist CRUD operations

### Option 2: Build "What Changed This Week" Dashboard
**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours

1. Create backend endpoint for score changes
2. Build `WeeklyChanges.tsx` page
3. Add score change indicators throughout app
4. Test with mock historical data

### Option 3: Quick Wins Before Phase 5
**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

- Add loading skeletons to improve perceived performance
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Implement responsive mobile navigation
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Create a "Getting Started" tour for new users

## 🐛 Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. **Large Bundle Size:**
   - Current: 645.71 kB (192.24 kB gzipped)
   - Consider code splitting with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`
   - Split Recharts into separate chunk

2. **No Error Handling on Charts:**
   - Add fallback UI when price data fails to load
   - Show empty state with helpful message

3. **Tailwind Dynamic Classes:**
   - Color classes like `bg-${color}-500` don't work with JIT
   - Need to use full class names or inline styles

4. **Missing Unit Tests:**
   - No tests for new Phase 4 components
   - Consider adding React Testing Library

5. **Accessibility:**
   - Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Test with screen readers

## 📊 Project Statistics

- **Total Phases:** 6
- **Completed:** 4 (67%)
- **Total Components:** 20+

## 💡 Tips for Next Session

1. **Start Backend First:** If building score tracking, create the database models and API endpoints before frontend work.

2. **Use Existing Patterns:** Follow the same patterns established in Phase 4 for consistency.

3. **Test Incrementally:** Test each feature as you build it rather than at the end.

4. **Mobile First:** Consider mobile layout from the start since watchlists are likely to be checked on mobile.

5. **Performance:** Watchlists could have many stocks, so consider pagination or virtualization.
