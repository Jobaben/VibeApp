**Date**: 2025-12-29 17:50
**Role**: Developer
**Story**: story-006 - Configure Docker Compose Services

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Removed Redis service, redis_data volume, REDIS_URL env, Redis dependency |

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] Redis service removed from docker-compose.yml
- [x] Backend service depends on `db` with `condition: service_healthy`
- [x] Backend no longer depends on Redis
- [x] Database service has working health check (`pg_isready`)
- [x] Backend service has working health check (`curl /health`)
- [x] Frontend service depends on backend
- [x] `docker-compose up` starts all 3 services (db, backend, frontend)
- [x] Services start in correct order: db → backend → frontend

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| docker-compose config (validation) | ✅ Pass |
| docker-compose up -d | ✅ Pass - all 3 services started |
| DB health check | ✅ Pass - status: healthy |
| Backend health check | ✅ Pass - status: healthy |
| Frontend accessible | ✅ Pass - returns HTML |
| curl /health | ✅ Pass - {"status":"healthy"} |
| No Redis in ps | ✅ Pass - only db, backend, frontend |
