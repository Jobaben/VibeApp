# Runlog: Dev Session - story-007

**Date**: 2025-12-29 19:00
**Role**: Developer
**Story**: story-007 - Enable Hot Reload with Volume Mounts

## Files Modified

None - volume mounts were already correctly configured in story-006.

## Verification Activities

1. Confirmed docker-compose.yml has correct volume mounts
2. Tested backend hot reload (uvicorn --reload)
3. Tested frontend HMR (Vite with --host)
4. Verified node_modules isolation via anonymous volume

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] Backend code changes trigger uvicorn auto-reload
- [x] Frontend code changes trigger Vite HMR in browser
- [x] node_modules are isolated in container (not overwritten by host)
- [x] Editing `backend/app/*.py` reflects in running container
- [x] Editing `frontend/src/*.tsx` reflects in browser without refresh
- [x] Container restart not required for code changes

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Backend reload on file change | ✅ Pass - "WatchFiles detected changes in 'main.py'. Reloading..." |
| Frontend HMR configured | ✅ Pass - @vite/client and @react-refresh in page |
| File changes visible in container | ✅ Pass - Immediate sync via bind mount |
| node_modules isolation | ✅ Pass - Container has own .yarn-integrity from build |
| Frontend accessible | ✅ Pass - http://localhost:3000 returns HTML |
