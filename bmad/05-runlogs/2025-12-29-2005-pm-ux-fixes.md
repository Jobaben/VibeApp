# Runlog: PM Session - UX Fixes Requirements

**Date**: 2025-12-29 20:05
**Role**: Product Manager

## Input

Read brief: `bmad/00-brief/brief-learning-mode-and-empty-stocks.md`

## Requirements Added

Updated `bmad/01-prd/PRD.md` with addendum containing:

### Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR-14 | Learning Mode shall default to OFF |
| FR-15 | Learning Mode state shall only persist when user explicitly enables it |
| FR-16 | Database shall be seeded with sample data on Docker startup |
| FR-17 | Seed script execution shall be idempotent |

### Acceptance Criteria
- AC-07: Learning Mode Default State
- AC-08: Learning Mode Persistence (only restore if user explicitly enabled)
- AC-09: Database Auto-Seeding

### User Stories
- US-06: Learning Mode OFF by default
- US-07: Database auto-seeded for Docker

## Artifacts Modified

- `bmad/01-prd/PRD.md` - Added addendum section

## Decision Notes

1. **Learning Mode**: Chose to track explicit user choice rather than just presence of localStorage data. This ensures users who never enabled Learning Mode won't have it auto-activate.

2. **Database Seeding**: Made it automatic on Docker startup (FR-16) rather than manual step, improving developer experience per original Docker epic goals.

## Handoff

Recommended next step: `/scrum` to create stories for:
- story-010: Fix Learning Mode Default State
- story-011: Auto-Seed Database on Docker Startup
