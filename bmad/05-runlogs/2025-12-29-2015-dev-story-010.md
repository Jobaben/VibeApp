**Story**: story-010 - Fix Learning Mode Default State

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `frontend/src/contexts/LearningModeContext.tsx` | Added explicit isEnabled persistence |

## Implementation Summary

1. Added `ENABLED_KEY` constant for separate localStorage key
2. Updated load effect to only restore `isEnabled` from explicit storage
3. Added save effect to persist `isEnabled` state on change
4. Updated `resetProgress` to clear the enabled key

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] Learning Mode toggle shows OFF on first visit
- [x] Learning Mode remains OFF even with old localStorage data
- [x] Explicitly enabling Learning Mode persists across sessions
- [x] Disabling Learning Mode persists across sessions
- [x] Clearing localStorage resets to OFF
