**Story:** [STORY-002] Fix Backend Pagination API Contract
**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Verdict:** PASS

## Summary

Reviewed the implementation of story-002 which fixes the backend pagination API contract to align with frontend expectations.

## Review Activities

1. **Code Review**
   - Reviewed git diff for `router.py` and `schemas/__init__.py`
   - Verified parameter changes from `skip`/`limit` to `page`/`page_size`
   - Verified response changes to include `page`, `page_size`, `total_pages`
   - Confirmed calculation logic: `total_pages = (total + page_size - 1) // page_size`

2. **Test Verification**
   - Ran 11 tests related to pagination
   - All tests pass (2 unit, 9 integration)
   - Edge cases covered: empty DB, page beyond total, invalid params

3. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Implementation matches ADR-001 specification exactly
   - Frontend types already expected `page`, `page_size`, `total_pages`
   - No frontend changes required

4. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - All 9 criteria verified and met
   - No issues found

## Findings

No issues found. Implementation is clean, well-tested, and follows the architecture document precisely.
