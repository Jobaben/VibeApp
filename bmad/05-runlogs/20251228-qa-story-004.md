- Read `bmad/02-architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (ADR-003)

## Review Process

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Verification

All 6 criteria verified through static code analysis:

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Loading dark background | ✅ Line 82 |
| Blue spinner | ✅ Line 84 |
| Error dark theme | ✅ Line 93 |
| No white flash | ✅ All states identical |
| Readable loading text | ✅ Line 85 |
| Theme consistency | ✅ Line 121 |

### 2. Architecture Alignment

- ADR-003 compliance verified
- All three states (loading, error, main) use same gradient

### 3. Code Quality

- Valid Tailwind classes
- Sufficient contrast for accessibility
- No hardcoded values

## Output

- Created `bmad/04-qa/review-story-004.md`
- Updated story status to Done
- Added QA notes to story file

## Verdict

**PASS** - All acceptance criteria verified. This was a verification-only story; no code changes were needed as the implementation already met specifications.
