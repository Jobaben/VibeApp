# Architecture Document

## Overview
<!-- High-level architectural approach -->

### System Context
<!-- How does this system fit into the broader ecosystem? -->

### Design Principles
<!-- Guiding principles for architectural decisions -->

## Architecture

### Component Descriptions
<!-- Purpose and responsibility of each component -->

| Component | Responsibility | Technology |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| | | |

## Data Design

### Data Models
<!-- Key entities and relationships -->

### Data Flow
<!-- How data moves through the system -->

## API Design
<!-- Interface contracts between components -->

### Endpoints / Interfaces
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|

## Security Considerations
<!-- Authentication, authorization, data protection -->

## Performance Considerations
<!-- Scalability, caching, optimization strategies -->

## Deployment Architecture
<!-- How is this deployed? Infrastructure requirements -->

## Architectural Decisions
