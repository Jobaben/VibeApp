Think of it as doing your homework before buying something important.\n\nThere are two main goals:\n\n**1. Understanding Value** - Is this stock worth its current price? A great company at the wrong price can still be a poor investment.\n\n**2. Assessing Quality** - Is this a good business? Does it make money consistently? Is it growing?\n\nGood investors don't just follow tips or hunches. They analyze data, understand trends, and make informed decisions.
